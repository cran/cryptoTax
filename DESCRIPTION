Description: Helps calculate crypto taxes in R. First, by allowing 
  you to format .CSV files from various exchanges to one
  large data frame of organized transactions. Second, by allowing you to 
  calculate your Adjusted Cost Base (ACB), ACB per share, and 
  realized and unrealized capital gains/losses. Third, by calculating
  revenues gained from staking, interest, airdrops, etc. Fourth, by 
  calculating superficial losses as well. *Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.
